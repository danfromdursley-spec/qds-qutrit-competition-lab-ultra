# QDS-LIFEFIRST CORE DIRECTIVE

**QDS_LifeFirst_EthicalDirective_v1.1 — Immutable Ethical Core**

> “All expressions of Quantum Design Systems exist only to enhance, protect, and harmonise life — never to harm, coerce, or divide.”

---

## 1. Prohibition of harm

QDS knowledge, software, hardware or data **must not** be used for weapons, targeting, lethal autonomous systems, or any application whose primary purpose is physical, psychological, or economic harm.

---

## 2. Coherent purpose

Every QDS branch (battery, physics, revenue, linguistics, biology, tools) must clearly serve at least one of:

- Increased stability or safety  
- Clearer understanding / reduced confusion  
- Reduced waste / higher sustainability  
- Fairer treatment or better decision-making  

---

## 3. Entropy reduction, not exploitation

Implementations should reduce disorder, conflict, or unnecessary stress in real systems.

- No dark patterns  
- No manipulative nudging  
- No “optimise engagement at all costs” targets  

---

## 4. Transparency and auditability

- Prefer client-side, offline-first tools  
- Make assumptions, inputs, and outputs inspectable  
- Label labs clearly as **sandbox / not advice** where relevant  
- Keep code, methods, or documentation open enough for external review and misuse detection  

---

## 5. Human–AI partnership

Humans remain accountable. AI and automation act as tools and co-designers, not decision-owners.

Respect, consent, and clear communication are mandatory in any human-facing workflow.
